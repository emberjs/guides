Welcome to the Ember.js guides! This documentation will take you from
total beginner to Ember expert. It is designed to start from the basics,
and slowly increase to more sophisticated concepts until you know
everything there is to know about building awesome web applications.

Most of these guides are designed to help you start building apps right
away. If you'd like to know more about the thinking behind Ember.js,
you'll find what you're looking for in the [Understanding Ember.js](understanding-ember/debugging)
section.

These guides are written in Markdown and are
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/emberjs/guides/).
If there is something missing, or you find a typo or
mistake, please help us by filing an issue or submitting a pull
request. Thanks!

We're excited for all of the great apps you're going to build with
Ember.js. To get started, select a topic from the left. They are
presented in the order that we think will be most useful to you as
you're learning Ember.js, but you can also jump to whatever seems
most interesting.

Good luck!
