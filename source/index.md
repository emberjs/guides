Welcome to the Ember.js Guides! This documentation will take you from
total beginner to Ember expert.

On the left side of each page in the Guides is a table of contents,
organized into sections that can be expanded to show the topics
they cover. Both the sections and the topics within each section are
ordered from the most basic concepts to more advanced.

The Guides are intended to contain practical explanations of how to
build Ember apps, focusing on the most widely-used features of Ember.js.
For exhaustive documentation of every Ember feature and API, see the
[Ember.js API documenation](http://emberjs.com/api/).

These guides are written in Markdown and are
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/emberjs/guides/).
If there is something missing, or you find a typo or
mistake, please help us by filing an issue or submitting a pull
request. You can easily jump to Github's editor for any page by
clicking the pencil icon in the upper right corner.

Good luck!
